                <h2>About me:</h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to introduce myself,  my name is Abdallah Kamal Jabr. an ambitious person who loves to learn and evolve. Iâ€™m 22 years old. I come from Palestine, Nablus. I majored in Computer Science. I always seek to develop myself through experiences.
                </p>

                <p>  
                    My journey in the world of technology and programming started when I was 14 years old when I was chosen from among a number of students applying for a three-year-long program to learn programming, entrepreneurial skills, and design thinking.
                </p>


                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I was a teaching assistant (TA) in teaching the basics of coding and artificial intelligence to young kids and high school students with multiple software companies in Palestine (PGF, Palestine EdTech Hub) to help them build their own games using all skills learned before. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, As for the professional side, I have trained in frontend development, where I enhanced my technical skills, and I hold the position of IT coordinator in the technical team, at Paltel Group Foundation, to provide the foundation with technical input and support operations while implementing coding and entrepreneurship projects and activities.                
                </p>


                <h3>Internships, Traineeship and Community Involvment</h3>
                <p>
                    I was a marketing team member as a Designer in the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) at Birzeit University.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I participated with a group of youth participants who got selected by the Amideast for a training program to enhance Palestinian students' personal, technical, and professional skills, which ended to choose 6 participants to participate in an intensive Bootcamp to represent the Palestinian emerging youth in a Professional Development Immersion Program funded by the US Embassy in Jerusalem, Amideast, and legacy International in Washington D.C. and New York.
